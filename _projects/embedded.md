As part of the course CS 684 Embedded Systems, I implemented the unique idea of hexapod performing dance moves spontaneously to match the music. Six different dance moves were designed. The major challenge was mapping the steps in a dance move to the beats of the music track based on the motion constraints of the hexapod.

The hexapod used was Firebird V. An Android application was developed from which the user can select the music track. The communication between the hexapod and Android phone happened via Bluetooth.
