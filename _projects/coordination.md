In the course Motion Planning and Coordination of Autonomous Vehicles, I worked on a project on multi-agent systems which targeted the problem of autonomous driving of a vehicle in urban/city block environments with other moving vehicles and pedestrians. I implemented a planning technique in which the vehicle decides the choice of turn at the intersection based on the probability of collision with the anticipated future trajectories of randomly moving obstacle vehicles.
