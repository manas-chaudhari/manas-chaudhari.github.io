# About Me

{% include image.html src="dp.jpg" align="right" size="small"%}

I am a techie presently working as software developer at TinyOwl. I graduated from the Department of Energy Science, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2014.

I am very passionate about robotics, more specifically its navigation aspects. I like to dance hip-hop, drumming. I also like trekking, adventure sports.

## Robotics

Being a techie, I was always into things like drones, RC cars. Getting inspired from Prof. Sebastian Thrunâ€™s course on [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373), I took up the topic â€˜Energy Optimal Path Planning in Mobile Robotsâ€™ for my Masterâ€™s Thesis. I was also part of IIT Bombayâ€™s team for Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition, conducted by Oakland University, at Michigan.

Nowadays, in my free time, I am learning about [Aerial Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-flight/) on Coursera. I am also planning to build a quadcopter to implement the mechanisms taught in the course.

## App Development

I had my first experience of programming in high school. We had courses for c++ as well as hardware programming (which involved writing hex code instructions into the processor ðŸ˜Ž). Ever since then, I have been fascinated by it. I started mobile app development as a hobby. After graduation, I took it up as a profession. I have worked on Android, iOS and Windows Phone mobile platforms.

I like to explore and create new patterns, which allow faster/stable development. I also contribute to open source libraries when I can. I blog about my findings [here](/blog).

## Dance
Apart from all these technical activities, I like to dance hip-hop. I have attended dance classes for around 5 years. I am part of IITBâ€™s dance club InSync. Check out this playlist for my dance videos.

## Adventure Sports

I have explored various adventure sports such as surfing, rafting, scuba diving, paragliding. I participate in them whenever I get a chance. I also like trekking.
